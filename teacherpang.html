                <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
                <p>I believe that teachers have the power to change how a student sees the world. The world can be harsh, but it also has kindness. It can be a place of wonder with so much to explore. It can be full of opportunities for them to grow and contribute. Technology has opened so many possibilities for people with disabilities. As a teacher, I believe that given proper guidance and support, people with special needs can grow into people with special strengths. </p>
                <br />
                <p>With my knowledge of computer science, passion for software development, and experience working as a programmer, I have the skills to teach what I know and develop the tools needed to improve students’ learning. I have studied sign languages and braille to equip myself with the necessary skills to communicate with disabled students.</p>
                <br />
                <p>My goals are to make an inclusive learning environment where students believe in their potential and abilities despite their circumstances and to guide students' learning so they can use their knowledge and skills to help those in need.</p>

                <p>Since I was as young as eight years old, I've always loved teaching. I often play with younger kids the "classroom game" where I pretend to be a teacher and them my students. Sometimes, it was the reverse. There's something magical about sharing your knowledge and skills with others. Right then, I knew I wanted to be a teacher.</p>

                </quote>
                <p>Then I got into high school, and my perspective on teaching changed. Teaching didn't look fun when my high school teacher screamed her lungs out, telling us, "we're the worst batch ever"—seeing my teachers behind piles of paperwork after school didn't look fun. It didn't look fun when teachers went from friendly banter to resentment towards fellow teachers. So when I finished high school, I took a totally different path instead of pursuing my childhood dream: take up a course I wasn't good at. Math. Specifically, the science of computing.</p>

                    <p>"I am beginning to suspect all elaborate and special systems of education. They seem to me to be built up on the supposition that every child is a kind of idiot who must be taught to think."</p>

                </quote>   
                <p>During my last year at university, I met the Deaf community, and my life made a U-turn. While working as a Deaf interpreter for college students, I was reminded of what truly makes teaching remarkable. In front of me were passionate and curious learners. They are capable of anything except hearing. But not hearing made it difficult, and their teachers didn't know how to teach them according to their needs. As an interpreter, I was restricted in what I could do to help. So I finally decided to become a teacher despite the challenging moments that come with teaching. I don't need to make a difference. I simply want young people to have a chance to discover their potential regardless of their circumstances.</p>
