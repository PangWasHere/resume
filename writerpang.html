          .. there was a girl who wanted to be a writer.<br />
          <br />
          As she started learning to hold a pen to write, her mind was anxious
          for stories. She would grab any book she could find and read to her
          heart&rsquo;s content. When she turned 10, a teacher opened the door
          to the world of written thoughts. She began writing for competitions
          as a feature writer, both in her homeland language, Filipino, and the
          global lingua franca, English. She was thrilled as she wrote: fiction
          and fact, academic and creative, short and long. <br />
          <br />
          When she stepped into high school, she started writing her hidden
          feelings through short stories and poems. She held the guitar for the
          first time when she was thirteen and realized the beauty of her
          thoughts in melody. College taught her the different styles of writing
          and research papers became interesting articles for her to write. When
          she graduated with her bachelor&rsquo;s degree, she could write words
          understood by humans and computers. Now, she longs to write not just
          to tell but to encourage, not for grades but for awareness, not only
          to remember but to instill.<br />
          <br />
          Her cabinet is filled with diaries but her mind still has lots to
          convey. Would there be enough space in this digital world for what she
          wishes to say?
